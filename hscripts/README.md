# HScripts
**HScripts** are like **Lua** scripts, but it's made with **Haxe** instead. *They might look like shitty... but chill, i'm still learning how to use that.*

> - **`ChipHUD.hx`:** Simple HUD, maybe not going to finish it.

>- **`Troll.hx`:** It closes your game when you miss and open a random YouTube link, lol.
