# HScripts
**HScripts** are like **Lua** scripts, but they're made with **Haxe** instead. *They might look shitty... but chill, i'm still learning how to use **HScript**.*

> - **`ChipHUD.hx`:** Simple HUD, maybe not going to finish it.

> - **`CamFollow.hx`:** The camera moves when the player/opponent hits a note.

>- **`Troll.hx`:** It closes your game when you miss a note, and opens a random YouTube link, lol.
